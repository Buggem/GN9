# GN9
### The critically unacclaimed platformer!



GN9 is a platformer game crossed with bullet hell games. Inspired by some of the very **BEST** and some of the **VERY WORST** games ever to be made, in GN9 you play as GN9 the circle. He is looking for a purpose in his world, since he doesn't really have any right now. So for no reason except ego, this hatable little circle sets out on a massive adventure to defeat all the bad guys (and get that SPECIL BADGE on his save file). However, he was too lazy to do it by himself, so he got the player to make decisions for him and control him in levels. Just letting you know he may die if you walk the wrong way or fight an enemy, but that is the least of his problems since he has nothing to lose.
